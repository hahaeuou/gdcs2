# 1: Interface

While on the website or localhost, navigate to [https://www.gdcreatorschool.com/admin](/admin). You should be prompted with a page asking you to log into Github.

You have to log with your Github account, and authorize the CMS.

Once you log in, you should see a page like this. Each page under "Guides" corresponds to a unit, such as Advanced Triggers.

Clicking on a unit will bring up all guides in that unit.

Clicking on a guide brings up the editing menu, which lets you make changes to guides. The right side is a **preview panel**, while the left side is the **editing panel** where you can make changes. Each section of the editing pannel corresponds to an attribute in the guide's **frontmatter**, check the [Formatting](/contributing/guidelines/formatting) guide to understand what is the frontmatter, and what each attribute does.
